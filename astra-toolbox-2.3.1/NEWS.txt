2.3.1 (2025-04-16)
 * fix GPULink missing in astra.data3d module
 * fix crash in Matlab when calling astra_mex_direct
 * fix missing accelerated virtual GPU code for CUDA architectures > 8.6 in Linux packages

2.3.0 (2025-02-22)
 * add support for zero-copy linking of GPU/CPU arrays from Python libraries supporting the DLPack
   standard, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, CuPy and JAX
 * add support for using different filter types in FDK_CUDA.
   The filter configuration for FDK_CUDA now matches that for FBP/FBP_CUDA.
 * add conda packages for Python 3.13, CUDA 12.6, 12.8, and NumPy 2
 * add automatic asynchronous execution to `astra.experimental` functions in Python
 * add automatic splitting of FDK execution along angular dimension, allowing for larger maximum
   number of projections
 * add error reporting in `astra.algorithm.run` function
 * add an extensive Python unit test suite
 * fix incorrect results with GPUs with more than 48GB of memory
 * fix multiple minor bugs
 * require C++17, raising minimum system requirements to CUDA 11
 * deprecate Python 3.7 conda packages
 * remove boost and six dependencies

2.2.0 (2024-07-12)
  * update Windows conda packages
  * add support for python 3.12, cuda 12.5, and numpy 2.0

2.1.3 (2023-10-04)
  * astra conda packages for cuda 11.6 and above now depend on nvidia's
    modular cuda packages instead of on the monolithic cudatoolkit package.
    This improves compatibility of our conda packages with pytorch.
  * speed up FDK, especially when using multiple GPUs
  * improve error reporting

2.1.2 (2022-09-09)
  * fix set_gpu_index with Python 3.10
  * fix set_gpu_index initializing GPU #0 before switching to the desired GPU

2.1.1 (2022-06-30)
  * fix memory leak in cone beam FP

2.1.0 (2022-01-31)
  * fix potential hang in CUDA FFT, and speed it up (for FBP_CUDA and FDK_CUDA)
  * fix GPULink with rows not padded to multiple of 32 pixels
  * fix output value scaling for short-scan FDK
  * improve CUDA error logging
  * fix compatibility issues with the conda-forge and nvidia conda channels

2.0.0 (2021-10-27)
  * fix inconsistent scaling of output value depending on detector pixel size
      See the 2020-01-17 news entry on astra-toolbox.com for more details
  * add experimental interfaces to FP3D, BP3D, FDK to make ASTRA calls
      by 3rd party toolboxes more efficient and flexible
  * improve compatibility with modern Python, CUDA, Linux and Windows versions

1.9.0 (2018-2019)
  * add 2D parallel_vec geometry
      The old ExtraDetectorOffset option has been removed. Please use
      parallel_vec to achieve this effect now
  * fix inconsistent rotation direction in CPU fan beam code
  * fix scaling of output values for FDK and fan beam FBP in some geometries

1.8.3 (2017-11-06)
  * fix geometry memory leak in 3D FP/BP
  * fix FDK short scan weighting
  * add preliminary support for building on macOS
  * add experimental support for using externally managed GPU memory from python
    (see samples/python/s021_pygpu.py)
  * our Linux conda python packages now have variants depending on the
    cudatoolkit version
  * add basic post-install tests test_CUDA/test_noCUDA (see README)

1.8 (2016-12-05)
  * the Windows binary release now requires CUDA 8.0
  * major changes to the way 'make install' works when building from source
  * removed GPU memory size restrictions for FDK
  * added multi-GPU support to 3D FP/BP/FDK
  * added relaxation factor option to SIRT, SART
  * fixed certain projections parallel to XZ or YZ planes
  * fixed accumulating multiple raylengths in SART
  * for matlab OpTomo, make output type match input type
  * for python OpTomo, add FP/BP functions with optional 'out' argument
  * fixed problems with non-US locales

1.7.1beta (2015-12-23)
  * NB: This release has a beta tag as it contains two new
    big experimental features.
  * fix crash with certain 2D CUDA FP calls

1.7beta (2015-12-04)
  * NB: This release has a beta tag as it contains two new
    big experimental features.
  * experimental MPI distributed computing support in Python
  * experimental support in Python for FP and BP of objects
    composited from multiple 3d data objects, at possibly different resolutions.
    This also removes some restrictions on data size for 3D GPU FP and BP.
  * support for Python algorithm plugins
  * removed restrictions on volume geometries:
        The volume no longer has to be centered.
        Voxels still have to be cubes, but no longer 1x1x1.
  * build fixes for newer platforms
  * various consistency and bug fixes
