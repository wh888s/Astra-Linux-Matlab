For questions and issues related to using the toolbox (not related to actual bugs in the code of the toolbox), please open a new discussion instead (https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox/discussions). We also recommend inspecting the existing documentation (https://astra-toolbox.com/docs/index.html) and examples (https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox/tree/master/samples).

1. Ensure the bug is not already reported (https://github.com/astra-toolbox/astra-toolbox/issues).
2. Provide a minimal reproducible example, if possible in code. Please use the code block functionality of GitHub (by using `/Code block` command or enclosing the code in triple grave mark symbols ``` ```).
3. Provide the version of ASTRA and source of installation (e.g. `astra-toolbox` channel in conda, `conda-forge` channel, pre-compiled binaries or manual installation).
4. (optional) For issues related to installation of ASTRA or to the CUDA functionality, please report the platform (Windows/Linux), the version of your Nvidia drivers, and in the case of conda installation the full list of packages installed in the environment, which can be obtained with `conda list` command.
